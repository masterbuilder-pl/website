In this medium-sized Star Wars diorama, three clone troopers make their way through a murky river, fleeing from advancing Separatist forces. The water is fast-flowing, turbulent, and dirtyâ€”the perfect backdrop for a dramatic retreat. Surrounded by rocks and lush vegetation, the scenery creates a subdued yet dynamic atmosphere. This MOC combines intense action with meticulous attention to detail, creating a story of survival in the face of combat.
