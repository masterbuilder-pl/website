This small but charming MOC depicts a kitchen styled after medieval times, where a woman cooks with passion for her family. Holding a piece of meat in her hand, she stands by the counter, where fresh fish lie ready to be prepared in the pot on the stove. The scene is rich in details: shelves filled with bottles and dishes, a row of kitchen knives, a barrel, and stone-textured walls with arched windows. It’s a warm, homely build full of atmosphere — not just about cooking, but about care, everyday life, and love told through bricks.
