This medium-sized MOC depicts a sturdy stone gate — a remnant of a castle or fortified stronghold. Built with detailed brickwork, iron bars, and subtle architectural accents, it also features a lion crest proudly displayed above the entrance. The gate is slowly being reclaimed by nature: vines climb the walls, shrubs grow at the base, and the uneven, rocky ground suggests a forgotten or abandoned place. Despite its age, the gate still stands tall, guarding secrets of a bygone era. A perfect standalone piece — or a striking part of a larger fantasy build.
