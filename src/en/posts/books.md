Amidst flowers and a stone path, in a quiet park diorama, a woman sits on a benchâ€”not alone, but with two books. This tiny yet richly detailed MOC reminds us that even the smallest place can hold great adventures... if only you pick up the book. Each block in this composition creates an atmosphere of peace and reflection. This is not just a park scene. It is a tribute to imagination, which begins on the very first page.
