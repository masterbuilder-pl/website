## How to Rebuild Lego Sets

Almost every Lego fan has an incomplete or dismantled set lying around. Many of you probably want to rebuild those sets. Here's how to go about it:

### 1. Sort Your Bricks by Color  
If you have dismantled sets, you surely have some loose bricks. Sorting them by color will make the process much easier.

### 2. Check Your Custom Builds  
There’s a good chance some of the needed bricks are in your own creations. They might also be in boxes or attached to other sets. When rebuilding, consider taking apart these builds to recover pieces.

### 3. Find the Instructions Online  
Search online for your set’s name plus “LEGO.” One of the first links should be the official Lego website.  
- Click it and go to the set’s page.  
- Look on the right-hand side (you might need to scroll) for **“Building Instructions.”**  
- Click it and download the most recent PDF version.  
- Scroll to the end of the PDF to find the **parts list**.  
- Print those last pages.  
If you can’t print, you’ll need to check off pieces directly in the instructions using a pencil.

### 4. Check Off Found Parts  
Go through the list and tick off parts you already have.  
- Use a separate box to store the “checked” parts so they don’t mix with the rest.  
- Sorting by color will help.  
- If you couldn’t print the list, you can mark pieces lightly in the manual.

### 5. Missing Pieces?  
It’s totally normal to be missing a few (or a dozen) parts.  
- Keep looking through your bricks.  
- If you can’t find them, you can buy the missing pieces on:  
  - BrickLink 
  - Lego’s **Pick a Brick** service  
  - Other online stores offering individual bricks

### 6. Substitutions or Skipping  
While waiting for parts or if you don’t want to order them:  
- Look for substitute pieces  
- Or just skip them if they’re not essential  
You can now assemble your set!

This method takes time, but it’s faster than other approaches—especially if you're rebuilding multiple sets. Sorting by color significantly speeds things up.  
Of course, you could build step-by-step following the manual and search for each piece as needed, but that method is much more time-consuming.

Have a dream set that's old and expensive? You can try to rebuild it this way too:
- Find what you can at home
- Buy the rest online or from local stores that sell Lego by weight

Using this method, I saved about **200 PLN** when rebuilding a set (though I didn’t have the minifigures).
