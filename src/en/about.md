👋 Hi! I'm a young LEGO® enthusiast who loves building custom MOCs (My Own Creations) and sharing free instructions with the community. I created legofan.pl to inspire others, showcase original builds, and bring together fans like you!

Your support helps me cover the cost of running the site (like the domain) and rewards the time I put into creating and publishing content. I’m planning to grow the site with even more features — news, alternative builds, building tips, promotions, reviews, and more.

If you like what I do and want to help me keep going, a coffee means the world to me. ☕❤️

Thank you for being part of this brick-built journey!
